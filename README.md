# Property-Manager
This project is a comprehensive MySQL database system designed to streamline property management operations. It efficiently tracks property owners, tenants, maintenance requests, and real estate agents, while also managing property listings, lease agreements, and agent commissions.

The system includes advanced SQL queries, such as JOINs and aggregate functions, to enable efficient data retrieval for lease tracking, maintenance request status updates, and commission calculations.
